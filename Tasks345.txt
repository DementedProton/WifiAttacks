                          Task 3
===========================================================
India has laws that apply both federally (centrally) and statewise. Any interference
with radio waves especially in conventionally utilized bands is strictly illegal by law
(classified under the heading "electronic jammers") and only government endorsed entities
are allowed to operate them (Police/Defense forces/Intelligence agencies). Any wilful
 interference is considered as a criminal offence.

For private networks, any such usage requires prior permission from one of many departments
Furthermore, sale/rent of any equipment capable of performing as a jammer is highly
restricted and audited. In the event of third-party interference being observed in private
networks, the only solution seems to be is to contact the relevant authorities. Or being
pro-active and requesting permission to use jammers beforehand.

                          Task 4
===========================================================

In the case of the broadcast frame, we cannot be completely certain of the
veracity of the group key. It could be possibly be sent by a malicious user present in
the network, as the group temporal key is shared amongst all the clients to encrypt
multicast frames.

However, the unicast frame can be verified using the MIC as the attacker will not be
able to calculate this MIC by himself and the frame can be ascertained to be from the
base station. Since it is also protected against replay attacks.
In the event of a attacker already present in the network (and aware of the PSK), he will be
able to sniff out the Anonce, snonce from the network and since he's already aware of the MAC
addresses involved in the system, he would be able to compute the PTK and hence would be able to sign
messages with a MIC that would be considered valid
